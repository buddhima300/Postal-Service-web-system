            It employs robust cryptographic algorithms such as AES and RSA to
            ensure that only authorized individuals can access encrypted
            content, providing an unparalleled layer of protection against
            unauthorized access. Token-based authentication and role-based
            access control (RBAC) further enhance security by ensuring that
            sensitive operations, like file decryption, are restricted to
            verified users with appropriate permissions. Additionally, the
            application adheres to global data protection standards, such as
            GDPR, ensuring that user data is handled with the highest levels of
            security and compliance.
